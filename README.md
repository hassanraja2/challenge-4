# challenge-4

<h2> What was the challenge? </h2>

The challenege was to use a playbook which installs docker onto the local machine. This was more of how to install docker manullay by using the step-by step method and installing all the required dependencies. 

<h2> How I expected the challenge to go? </h2>
This challlenge was mainly focused on using the Ansible Playbook but the documentaion really helped with solving the problems and achiving the oevrall goal.  

<h2> What went well? </h2>

I was comfortable with completing this challenge as the Ansible documentation is really helpful and easy to understand which allowed me to successfully install docker. 


<h2> What didn't go as planned? </h2>

I did encounter few errors on my code here and there but learning from my previous mistakes allowed me to solve the problem easily. 

<h2> Possible improvements for future challenges </h2>

I have found Ansible documentation really useful and for future challenges, I will try to look at relevant documentations to enable me to go on the right direction.
